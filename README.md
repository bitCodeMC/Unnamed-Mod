# Unnamed-Mod
This is my testing of different parts of modding.

###Items
Test Item- Summons Lightning
Bed Locator- Gives you the location of your bed
Coalnut- the best food
EndTp- Teleports you to the end
Slime in Bucket- Tells you if slimes can spawn in the chunk you are in
Drain- drains liquid in a radius
All other items do not work

###Blocks
Smoke-spreads up and disappears. Later, if you are in it, it will poison you
Personal Chest- Only the person who places it can open it
Test Block- Supposed to be an analog version of a redstone lamp, changing light level depending on redstone power
Feeder- Feeds you if you are near it

###Entities
Hedgehog
TraitorZombie- Attacks other Zombies instead of players and villagers
